# RACER
Rewrite of the Advanced Connect 4 Engine in Rust.

# Usage
* the /bin/ directory contains a CLI program (maybe GUI in the future) to play against the engine
* the /racer/ directory contains the Cargo Crate for general Connect-4 playing and use of the engine

# Development
RACER is currently in the early stages of development and as such may lack some features or contains some bugs!
